# Social Network Analysis
Analysis of a friend's social network

# **Project Summary**

## Network Overview
* Network source and preprocessing (API);
*	Node/Edge attributes:
     -	Size, Order;
     -	Diameter, radius;
     -	Clustering Coefficient (global, local);
     -	Average path length;
 * Degree distribution, fitting models.

## Structural Analysis
*	The closest random graph model similar to the analyzed social network (Erdos-Renyi,	Watts-Strogatz,	Barabasi-Albert,	Havel-Hakimi);
*	Degree/Closeness/Betweenness/Katz centralities;
*	Page-Rank & HITS. Correlation comparison of centralities and prestige;
*	Assortative Mixing according to node attributes (sex, city, educational status, university);
*	Node structural equivalence/similarity.

## Community Detection
*	Clique search, k-cores visualization.
*	Community detection algorithms: Edge-betweenness, Clauset-Newman-Moore, Girvan-Newman,	Spectral clustering,	Markov clustering.
